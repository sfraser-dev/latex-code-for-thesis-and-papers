Recompiling these latex files in Mar 2023.
Last compiled these files in 2006!
Was able to compile all the papers, but my PhD thesis wasn't comiling.
The "bear1", "bear2" and "bear3" images were missing.
I took a screenshot from my 2006 thesis PDF and created an .eps for them via xfig.
So, a minor hack to get back the bear images and allow latex compilation.
