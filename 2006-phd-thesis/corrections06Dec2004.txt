MAIN CORRECTIONS:

-  All figures tidied up and all typos corrected


9) Section 9.2, p.157: What was previously the "Watermarking code" appendix 
   (describes how the MATLAB and C code for watermarking with ECC functions)
   has been pasted into this section (beginning on the 2nd paragraph 
   "The C source code ... " and ending on top of p.160 "... results in 
   graphical format"). You said that this appendix should be in the main 
   body of the thesis.

9) Ch.9, p162: The paragraph below the MATLAB code snippet and above 
   equation (9.2) has been expanded to better describe Pfp values, message
   lengths and detector thresholds.  Before, it merely said "In the case of
   different message lengths, different detector thresholds values were used
   which would result in Pfp values of similar magnitude". 
   You asked me to explain this more.

9) Ch.9, p.167: An attempt to clarify the "JPEG quality ranges" via an 
   example is made (from the 2nd paragraph to the 2nd last paragraph 
   on p.167).

9) Ch.9, p.168, p169 and p.177: Koch line on plots changed from dashdot 
   to solid line and the text on these plots made clearer (as you said the
   graphs were only just visible and too similar).

9) Ch.9, p.172: Examples of 3 ROC graphs presented, which weren't there 
   before.


10) Just typos corrected.


11) p.217: Paragraph beginning "Over the five host images ... "
    has been extended to better explain how messages with low levels
    of repetition (rep.=3 and rep.=0) and no BCH coding can be seen to
    be the most robust. 

11) You pointed out that I had various statement throughout this chapter of
    "the robustness can be seen in Figure X ... " which needed more 
    explaining. These changes have been highlighted in marker pen.
    See p.217, p.218, p.221, p.222 and p.225.


12) Conclusion chapter (Ch.12, p.229): Added tiny introduction (4 lines)
    before sub section 12.1. Apart from this (and one typo), it is
    the same as the "Conclusions" chapter (Ch.12) I passed to you before 
    (along with the "Introduction" chapter (Ch.1) and the
    "Despeckling images: Results and Conclusions" chapter (Ch.5)).


App. A, B, C, D, E, F, G) Just typos corrected.


App. H) p.281: Reference to the 2 ROC papers that you passed to me added.

App. H) p.282: MATLAB code snippet of how to calculate a ROC graph has
	been added (which you suggested).

App. H) p.284: Example of a ROC graph included (which you suggested).


Bibliography) Website references standardised and last date accessed 
              included. See items: 9, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 54, 99, 
              100, 106, 109 & 113.
