<a>So you're thinking about writing up your thesis, huh?  If you're that
far, you've probably run across LaTeX a few
times already ("<em>Ha! Try hundreds!</em>")  A thesis looks like a
huge pain to TeX, but don't freak---a lot
of the work has been done for you already.  The University distributes
a style file with all the specifics demanded by the Library hard-coded.
 </a></p><p>
<a>Of course this means <em>you shouldn't change things!</em>
 </a></p><p>
<a>So, in fact, there's not a lot of LaTeX
tricks and hints specific to writing theses that don't apply to any old
LaTeX document.
 </a></p><p>
<a>One thing <strong>in particular</strong> you should look at is the 
</a><a href="#example">example thesis</a> distributed along with the style file.

Here's a few other things about LaTeX'ing theses:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="#example">example</a> thesis

</li><li><a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/page-set-up.html#headers">headers</a> with chapter
	titles, current date, etc. (Good for Drafts)

<h3><a name="example">An Example Thesis</a></h3>
Whoever made up the <tt>thesis.sty</tt> style file in the first place was
kind enough to come up with a little example thesis, too.  It tells you what
there is to a LaTeX'd thesis, what commands to call, and stuff like that.
It appears that the example files included below are the same as the ones
<a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/%7Edjun/djun.html">Djun</a> just "updated" on
the Math network.
 <p>
<a name="style-guide"><b><font size="+3">W</font>arning:</b></a>
(and I'm serious this time!)
</p><blockquote>
The style file <tt>thesis.sty</tt>  and the example thesis
were generated in <b>1989</b>, so it claims.  The <em>very specific format</em>
demanded by the Library may have <strong>changed</strong> between then
and now!  Use <tt>thesis.sty</tt> and the example thesis to get things up 
and running and edited, but before you get your thesis signed and submitted,
<b>check with the Library</b> and read <a href="http://unixg.ubc.ca:7001/1m/about-libraries/general-guides/theses.txt"><strong>Instructions for the
Preparation of Graduate Theses</strong></a> available from Graduate Studies.
</blockquote>

The example thesis has these parts.  You can <b>view</b> the files and
then download them with <em>File/Save_As</em>.  Just in case it's not
obvious, the <tt>xxxxx xxxx</tt> in these files is where you type
<em>your</em> text...

</dd><dt><img src="noFiles_files/red.gif"> <strong>Appendix</strong>
[<a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/example_thesis/appendix.tex">view</a>]
</dt><dd> The <code>\appendix</code> command does all sorts of weird and wonderful
things, like resetting the <code>\thechapter</code> counter (see
<a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/numbering.html">Numbering</a>,
<a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/title.html#contents">Table of Contents</a>), changes the
word "Chapter" to "Appendix", and so on.  Just call <code>\appendix</code>
once---after that, all <code>\begin{chapter}</code>'s will give Appendix B,
Appendix C and so on.  You might want to change the 
<a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/page-set-up.html#headers">headers</a> in the appendices, too.

</dd><dt><img src="noFiles_files/red.gif"> <strong>References</strong>
(not BibTeX'd)
[<a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/example_thesis/bib.tex">view</a>]
</dt><dd>This Bibliography example does things the one-time-only, hard way.
Since you're probably gonna wring a bunch o' papers out of your thesis, too,
you're better off using BibTeX to get
your <a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/bibtex.html">List of References</a>.

</dd><dt><img src="noFiles_files/red.gif"> <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
[<a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/example_thesis/chapter1.tex">view]</a>
</dt><dd>This file shows some of the more common LaTeX
features like figures, tables, and sections.

</dd><dt><img src="noFiles_files/red.gif"> <strong>Chapter 2</strong>
[<a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/example_thesis/chapter2.tex">view</a>]
</dt><dd>Same as Chapter 1.

</dd><dt><img src="noFiles_files/red.gif"> <strong>Table of Contents, Lists of Figures,
Tables</strong>
[<a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/example_thesis/lists.tex">view</a>]
</dt><dd>Don't trust the order these Lists are called in.  Check the 
<a href="#style-guide">Thesis Style Guide</a> for the correct order.  The
Guide also mentions what to do with a
<a href="#listofnotation">List of Notation</a>.

</dd><dt><img src="noFiles_files/red.gif"> <strong>Release Form</strong>
[<a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/example_thesis/relform.tex">view</a>]
</dt><dd>The <code>\authorizepage</code> hard-coded into the <tt>thesis.sty</tt>
file is <strong>obsolete</strong>!  You can get the correct form
from the Library.

</dd><dt><img src="noFiles_files/red.gif">  <strong>A root file</strong>
[<a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/example_thesis/thesis.tex">view</a>]
</dt><dd>You don't want to "re-compile" your whole thesis just to check the
spacing around equation 4.3.8.  It's better to break it up into pieces
that you <code>\include</code> piece by piece.  This root file
(called <tt>thesis.tex</tt> just so you can type <tt>latex thesis</tt> and
impress the people around you...) is where you set the order of all
the sections of the thesis.  Want your Appendices <em>after</em> the
List of References?  Just <code>\include{bib}</code> and <em>then</em>
<code>\include{appendix}</code>.

</dd><dt><img src="noFiles_files/red.gif"> <a name="title"><strong>Title Page</strong></a>
[<a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/example_thesis/title.tex">view</a>]
</dt><dd>Ahh, the Title Page.  Here's where using
LaTeX pays off big.  This sample title page
shows the fields you need to fill out.  Notice the double
slash <code>\\</code> in the <code>\previousdegrees</code> field
to list more than one degree.  Also, you may want to use
<pre>\department{Department of Mathematics}
</pre>
<font size="+1"><strong>IAM</strong></font> Students:  You need to mention
the IAM on your title page.  Try it like this:
<pre>\department{Department of Mathematics \\ Institute of Applied Mathematics}
</pre>
Honestly, the order of these two is a bit mysterious.  You might want
to check the politics with your supervisor...
 <p>
Finally, don't forget the one little command <code>\titlepage</code> which
does all the formatting and returns an awesome looking title page!

<h3>
<a name="chlists">Changing the Table of Contents, List of Figures, Tables</a>
</h3>
When you call <code>\tableofcontents</code>, <code>\listoftables</code>, or
<code>\listoffigures</code> in your source code <tt>thesis.tex</tt>, say,
LaTeX generates files <tt>thesis.toc</tt>, 
<tt>thesis.lot</tt>, and <tt>thesis.lof</tt>, respectively.  In these
files are the LaTeX sources for these
blocks of text.  If you don't like the way they look by default (maybe
too much space around some symbols, or no bold on math symbols in Chapter
titles) <strong>you can edit these files</strong>.  
 <p>
So here's what to do:
</p><ol>
<li> <tt>latex thesis.tex</tt>
</li><li> <tt>latex thesis.tex</tt> (the usual
gotta-LaTeX-twice...)
</li><li> Edit the <tt>thesis.</tt>[<tt>toc</tt>|<tt>lot</tt>|<tt>lof</tt>] files
</li><li> <tt>late</tt>... AHH! But if I run <tt>latex</tt> again, it will 
over-write my edited files!  Exactly!  So, you can:
<ul>
<li> <tt>cp</tt> the edited files elsewhere and then <tt>mv</tt> them back, or
</li><li> insert a <code>\nofiles</code> command in the preamble of the
source file.  This suppresses the output of new files.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>

<h3><a name="listofnotation">List of Notation</a></h3>

<p>
You can generate a List of Notation describing all your variables and
where they first appear.  It's not totally automated like, say, 
<code>\listoffigures</code> but it's a whole lot better than doing it
by hand.  (courtesy of
<a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/%7Ehaigh/haigh.html">Sue</a> and
<a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/%7Ewatmough/watmough.html">James</a>)

</p><p>
<img src="noFiles_files/listofnotation.gif">

</p><p>
If you have one of these lists, it is supposed
to go just after the main body of the thesis, just before the Bibliography.
But you might want to check with the Library before you make a final copy...

</p><h4>How to make a List of Notation</h4>
<p>
First you make a new file <tt>symbols.tex</tt>, say, with lines having
this format:
</p><pre>\addnotation \alpha: {some variable that means something to me}{alpha}
</pre>
where
<dl><dt><code>\addnotation</code>
</dt><dd>a TeX command you need to have
</dd><dt><code>\alpha:</code>
</dt><dd>the LaTeX code for the symbol.  You don't
have to add $...$ around math stuff.  Non-math symbols? Try it out.
<em>Be sure to add a trailing colon</em> : to separate the entries.
</dd><dt><code>{some variable that means something to me}</code>
</dt><dd>the description of the variable, enclosed in curly brackets {}
</dd><dt><code>{alpha}</code>
</dt><dd>a label that you'll use to tag the first occurance of the symbol.  See
the example source <tt>.tex</tt> file below.
</dd></dl>

<p>
In the preamble of the main LaTeX file, add these
lines:
</p><pre>\def\listofnotations{\input symbols.tex \clearpage}
\def\addnotation #1: #2#3{$#1$\&gt; \parbox{5in}{#2 \dotfill  \pageref{#3}}\\}
\def\newnot#1{\label{#1}}
</pre>

Where you want to put in the List of Notation, just put in the source file:
<pre>\markboth{List of Notation \hfill}{List of Notation \hfill}
\listofnotation
</pre>
The first line here is the change the page
<a href="http://www.iam.ubc.ca/%7Enewbury/tex/page-set-up.html#headers">headers</a>.

Finally, in the source for the main body of the text, the first time
you use a symbol (well, on the page where you first use the symbol),
include the <code>\newnot</code> command with the label you chose for
the symbol:
<pre>...
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ \newnot{alpha} is some variable that means something to me.
</pre>
Now that you've seen how it works, you can change it to include math and 
non-math symbols, use more or less space between the columns, get rid
of <code>\dotfill</code> and so on.
