called may23rd2006_part2 in
stewart@4i2i.com and stewart.ian.fraser@gmail.com
only small text files saved to these email accts for recompilation between machines (kelvinEng
and 4i2i machine) ... called this to be easily searched with other correction saves done during may

this thesis was created on my 4i2i computer

it uses the thesis 23march06.tar (from kelvin /opt) as a backbone

it took this tar file and consolidated all the .tex files into a single .tex file (topLevel4_nofiles.tex).

note that the "nofiles" manual correction is no longer needed in this file, the problem doesn't happen here

none of the seperate figure files (eg/ PS pics, xfig, etc) were altered, only the text was altered (a lot!) in order to
implement the viva minor corrections

so copying topLevel4_nofiles.tex and bibPhdThesis.bib to the thesis directory on kelvin and latex recompiling will
produce the same topLevel4_nofiles.ps final thesis

note: I have called it Ph.D.  not PhD. Ph.D. only occurs on title page and as reference to Kutter's PhD
thesis. 
TO DO
ask hard binders at library to put Ph.D. on spine as default is PhD 
note: 1st 2 hard bound thesis to registry had a text (subsection title) too wide on p.203 (over margins
a wee bit, but not too bad so handed in anyway as rushing to make graduation deadline!!) and PhD
(not Ph.D.) on the spine. this text too wide has been corrected in here.

final changes made here to this thesis version ... p200 and p203 -> Conclusions for XXXX changed to
XXXX: Conclusions

thesis4i2iMachine is the directory "c:\thesis march 26" from 4i2i computer zipped using fileZip.
note that "c:\thesis march 26" is ~1GB when unzipped.
