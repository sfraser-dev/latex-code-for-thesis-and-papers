DON'T PANIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

30 Nov 2004


MAIN CORRECTIONS:

-  All figures tidied up and all typos corrected

-  Abstract shortened to 1 page

-  I have already passed Chapters 1 and 5 to you, included here for completeness

1) Old, long abstract converted into an Introduction chapter (Ch. 1)
   I have already passed this altered chapter to you


2) New summary section for Ch. 2 (p. 40)

2) Visual artifacts section (Ch. 2, p. 35) now includes more emphasis 
   on computational complexity for different transforms in order to
   tie in with Ch. 3 better


3) Ch. 3, Section 3.1 (p. 43) rewritten to better compare the attributes 
   of different transforms and argue the case for the wavelet A TROUS

3) The last paragraph of Section 3.1 (p. 50) is new

3) Section 3.2.4 (p. 57) rewritten to better clarify the difference
   between SIGMA_{j} and SIGMA_{j}^{s}

3) Section 3.3 (p. 62) has been rewritten to highlight the advantages
   of the wavelet A TROUS


4) "Summary of image quality metrics" (Secion 4.5, p. 80) now includes
   more references to papers on image quality metrics


5) This chapter has been completely rewritten to include PSNR and TPE
   (from the Watson metric) measurements, it tests more filters and shows
   how our novel algorithm is better than the Yu algorithm on which it was 
   based
   I have already passed this altered chapter to you


6), 7) and 8) Just typos and tidying up
